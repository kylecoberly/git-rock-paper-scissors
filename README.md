# Rock, Paper, Scissors with Git

1. One partner should fork this repo and add the other partner as a
   collaborator, then both partners should clone the fork
2. Create a file called `player` and set it to your first name (for example,
   `echo "Kyle" > player`)
3. Change the contents of the `choice` to be either `rock`, `paper`, or
   `scissors`, then run `./throw` to set and obscure your answer. It will be
   automatically commited.
4. Push the repo to sync with the remote. Note that if your partner pushed
   before you, you'll need to pull before you can push. If they push after you,
   pull their commit.
5. Once you've both pushed and pulled to sync your repos, run `./score` to see
   the results!
6. Run `./totals` to see the results of all of your games.
